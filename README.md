Welcome, I'm Giorgio Desideri. These project is created to collect all pieces / snippets of code that can be usefull for understanding and knowledge.

Goals:
- not requirement dictation only the will to explain and let understand;
- not the best silver bullet solution, but the "best" meaningfull solution;

## Usage

Requirements:
- use only JUnit 4.11 library
- no add other library to pom.xml or folders, use only standard Java code. 
- keep Java version 8 standard.

Procedure:
- create your package for scope of your code. Before, check if it already exists;
- add your code;
- add your test unit for your code: 
	- can write single test case classes, 
	- or unite them under test suite case to launch;
	
- document your code, help other to undestand your contribution;
- add Apache License to your code.
